title: About me
subtitle: “I have a million ideas. They all point to certain death.” - Marvin

I am an undergrad student at Shiv Nadar University, currently pursuing my major in Electronics and Communication. I'm obessed with technology, ever since I was a kid. I grew up in a family of engineers, with the environment always conducive to building big or small projects and thinking about and sharing new ideas.

I keep myself busy by involving myself in some technological challenge or another. Through my undergrad years, I have developed keen interest in Machine Learning and am enamored with the potential of ML and DL to solve multitude of problems. With my background in engineering and math, and experience and hands-on knowledge in EDA and Data Science & AI, I seek to innovate on creating AI interventions for embedded hardware and beyond! (and hence a lot of my blogs would be my experiecnes and explorations in the field). 

I am an avid musician. I play the piano and love to improvise and compose my own music. 

I am also deeply interested in exploring ways to tackle the SDGs using technology. I believe that technology has the potential to solve all the major social and ecological problems that exist in the world, and I strive to find it. 

### Experience
- EDA
- NLP
- IoT
- DLT
- Robotics


### Musings
- Edge Computing
- Low Power Neural Processing
- Cybersecurity
- Human Cognition
- Technology Entrepreneurship
- Sustainable Development
- Music Composition

So stay tuned for my magical journey through the oceans of machine learning, music and technology innovation in general. I hope to share my experiences, projects and ideas. Sometimes, they might just be monologues of my take in the philosophy of life (if you'd go for that sort of thing :P)
