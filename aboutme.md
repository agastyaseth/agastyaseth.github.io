Greetings! I'm Agastya Seth, a graduate student at Arizona State University, where I'm delving deeper into the realms of Computer Science with a focus on Natural Language Processing and AGI. My journey in technology, rooted in a family of engineers, has evolved from an undergrad in Electronics and Communication at Shiv Nadar University to a more specialized path in data science and AI.

My obsession with technology, kindled since childhood, continues to grow. I now find myself at the intersection of advanced software engineering and innovative research. At the CogInt NLP Lab, under Prof. Baral's guidance, I've explored the frontiers of AI, working on projects like 'RL for Reasoning Logic' and 'LLM Safety'. These experiences have not only sharpened my technical skills but also broadened my perspective on the ethical and practical implications of AI.

I still keep myself immersed in various technological challenges. My background in engineering and math, coupled with hands-on experiences in EDA at Cadence Design Systems and AI-driven interventions, has equipped me to innovate at the cutting edge of AI applications in software engineering and beyond. Expect to see more in my blogs about these adventures and discoveries in AI and software development.

My passion for music remains a constant companion. As an avid pianist, the art of improvisation and composition continues to be a source of joy and creativity in my life.

One of my deep-seated interests is in leveraging technology to address Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I firmly believe in the transformative power of technology to address pressing social and ecological challenges, and I'm dedicated to contributing to this field.
