# Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity

At the heart of today's AI research, scale emerges as a monumental frontier. Observations have illuminated a simple yet profound truth: uncomplicated architectures, when backed by substantial computational resources, expansive datasets, and a vast number of parameters, consistently outshine their more complex counterparts. This naturally leads us to ponder a critical question: how can we train larger-scale models without sacrificing computational efficiency? The paper in discussion introduces an intriguing solution—leveraging sparsity and hard routing to significantly expand a model's parameters while maintaining constant FLOPs per forward pass. The concept of a Mixture-of-Experts, first unveiled in a pioneering 2017 Google Brain study, marked a departure from conventional wisdom. Traditionally, machine learning models apply the same parameters across all inputs. In contrast, the Mixture of Experts paradigm selects distinct parameters for each input, challenging the status quo. This innovative approach has since been woven into the fabric of nearly every leading-edge model today, including Mistral (Mistral 8x7B) and GPT-4, signaling its transformative impact on the field.



## Introduction and background

This paper introduces a major leap in the ability to scale up model parameters without a corresponding increase in computational demand. It explores the potential of using extremely large models within the limitations of existing hardware by introducing the "Switch Transformer" concept. This approach addresses the significant computational costs usually associated with scaling up transformer-based models by incorporating sparsity and a mechanism called Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Unlike traditional methods that use the same parameters for all inputs, MoE models choose specific parameters for each input, a novel approach that has been refined in this work.

The study goes beyond theory to show how it's now feasible to train models with trillions of parameters, overcoming previous hurdles such as computational inefficiency, complexity, and training instability. It simplifies the MoE routing algorithm, reducing both communication and computational overhead, and introduces training techniques that stabilize the training of these large models in lower precision formats.

These contributions highlight the paper's importance in pushing forward the scalability and efficiency of AI models, offering practical insights and methodologies for training larger models more effectively.



## The Switch Transformer

### Core Concept of Switch Transformers

Switch Transformers introduce a method to scale model parameters significantly while managing computational demands efficiently. The core concept is sparse routing, where inputs are directed through specific pathways or "experts" based on their characteristics, instead of engaging the entire model for every input. This approach reduces computational load and allows for larger model scales without linear increases in computation.

The efficiency of sparse routing is achieved through a dynamic algorithm that assigns inputs to the most relevant experts. The model integrates this with a set of specialized experts and a mechanism for combining their outputs, ensuring effective use of computational resources.

Training these large models involves novel techniques to maintain stability and efficiency, including specific learning rate adjustments, regularization methods tailored for sparse architectures, and adaptive training strategies. These elements collectively enable the Switch Transformer to learn effectively from vast datasets while maintaining a manageable computational footprint, offering a practical solution for developing and training large-scale AI models.



### Architecture

The Switch Transformer architecture innovatively scales up the parameter count of Transformer models in a computationally efficient manner. This approach was inspired by the exhaustive study of the benefits of scale, revealing power-law scaling with model size, dataset size, and computational budget. Central to the Switch Transformer's design is the goal of increasing parameter count while keeping floating point operations (FLOPs) per example constant, thereby addressing a separate and crucial scaling axis.

A key element in this architecture is the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) routing mechanism, simplified for efficiency. The MoE layer takes a token representation \(x\) and routes it to the top-k determined experts out of a set ${E_i(x)}_{i=1}^{N}$ of $N$ experts. The routing is determined by the router variable $W_r$ producing logits $h(x) = W_r \cdot x$, which are normalized via a softmax distribution over the $N$ experts. The probability of routing to expert \(i\) is given by the equation:

$p_i(x) = \frac{e^{h(x)_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}e^{h(x)_j}}$

This formula ensures that the input is directed to the most relevant expert, based on the routing logic's output. The output y*y* from the mixture-of-experts (MoE) layer is computed as a weighted sum of the outputs from all the experts, where the weights are determined by the routing probabilities. This is crucial for integrating the expert contributions back into the model's workflow. The equation for computing the output $y$ is as follows:

$y=∑p_i(x)E_i(x)$

Switch Transformers introduce a significant shift by simplifying this routing to select only a single expert per token, which reduces routing computation and enhances performance. This singular routing strategy, or "Switch" layer, not only simplifies the model's architecture but also significantly reduces the computational load.

Furthermore, the architecture's efficiency is bolstered by distributed training setups where the model's sparsely activated layers distribute unique weights across different devices. This distribution allows the model's weight to increase with the number of devices without overwhelming the memory and computational resources of each device. 

In essence, the Switch Transformer architecture employs a blend of simplified sparse routing, efficient use of hardware, and distributed training strategies to achieve scalability and computational efficiency. This framework supports the training of models with an unprecedented number of parameters, paving the way for advancements in large-scale machine learning applications.

## Data, Model, and Expert Parallelizm

The authors propose a sophisticated strategy for scaling Transformer models by harnessing parallel computing across data, models, and experts. This approach addresses the challenge of enhancing model capacity without hitting the performance bottleneck commonly associated with linear parameter scaling. Rather than merely expanding the model size, the authors advocate for a multifaceted scaling strategy that incorporates parallelism to optimize computational resources.

In their exploration, the authors identify that simply adding more experts to the model linearly increases the parameter count but can lead to diminishing performance returns. To circumvent the limitations imposed by hardware memory when scaling models traditionally, they introduce a blend of data, model, and expert-parallelism. This blend involves distributing the model's workload across multiple processing units to manage its expanding complexity and size efficiently.

Data parallelism is achieved by replicating the model across all cores, with each core processing a different subset of the data, effectively leveraging multiple cores to train on large datasets simultaneously. Model parallelism, on the other hand, involves splitting the model's parameters across different cores, necessitating communication between cores to synchronize the distributed parts of the model. Expert-parallelism is particularly tailored to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer, allocating different experts to different cores, thereby scaling the model's capacity by increasing the number of experts without overburdening each core with additional computational demands.

To illustrate the application of these parallelism strategies, the authors discuss the partitioning of the Transformer's Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layer across cores, employing Mesh TensorFlow for the practical implementation of this partitioning. This method allows for the efficient scaling of models to sizes previously unattainable, by making full use of the hardware's capacity, balancing computational load, and minimizing the necessity for communication between cores.

By integrating data, model, and expert-parallelism, the authors navigate the complexities of scaling Transformer models, demonstrating how to effectively increase model size and capacity. This approach enables the training of models with trillions of parameters, significantly advancing the capabilities of natural language processing and broader AI applications.

The authors revisit the concept of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in the context of Switch Routing, challenging the previously held notion that routing to more than one expert is necessary for effective learning and non-trivial gradients. Contrary to earlier studies that suggested the importance of routing to multiple experts for model training and gradient flow, the authors propose a simplified strategy that routes each token to only a single expert. This approach, referred to as a Switch layer, is shown to preserve model quality while reducing the complexity of routing computation and improving overall performance.

The benefits of employing a single expert routing strategy include a reduction in router computation since each token is directed to only one expert, thereby halving the batch size (or expert capacity) needed for each expert. This simplification not only reduces the computational burden but also simplifies the routing implementation and diminishes communication costs. The concept of a capacity factor plays a crucial role here, as it allows for the adjustment of expert capacity to manage token overflow effectively. A higher capacity factor can mitigate overflow issues but at the cost of increased computation and communication.

Furthermore, the authors address the differentiation of the router, emphasizing that the gate value, 
$p_i(x)$, in their formulation allows for the differentiation of routing decisions. This aspect is crucial for training the model, as it ensures that the routing mechanism itself can learn and adapt based on the training data, thus optimizing the allocation of tokens to experts over time.

In essence, Switch Routing as proposed by the authors represents a significant rethinking of the MoE paradigm. It simplifies the complexity associated with expert routing by focusing on a single-expert routing mechanism, thereby enhancing efficiency and model performance. This approach underscores the authors' broader objective of scaling Transformer models efficiently, by introducing sparsity and parallelism without compromising on model quality or increasing computational demands disproportionately.

The formula provided by the authors for calculating expert capacity is as follows:

$expert\ capacity=\frac{(tokens\ per\ batch)}{(number\ of\ experts)}×capacity\ factor$

These visuals help illustrate the diminishing returns on model performance as the number of parameters increases, highlighting the importance of balancing model size with computational efficiency.

Furthermore, the authors explore the concept of "capacity factor" within the context of scaling, demonstrating how adjusting this factor influences model performance and resource utilization. By fine-tuning the capacity factor, they show how models can be optimized to achieve better performance without unnecessarily increasing computational costs.
